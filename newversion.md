# Solar Sales Management System - New Version Updates

## Version Release Date: September 20, 2025

### üÜï Latest Updates

#### üîß Bug Fixes

**Stock Quantity Database Constraint Issue - FIXED**
- **Issue**: Sales creation/update failed with SQL errors when item quantities would go negative
- **Root Cause**: Items table `quantity` column was defined as `unsignedInteger`, preventing negative values
- **Solution**: 
  - Created migration to change `quantity` column from `unsignedInteger` to `integer` (signed)
  - Re-enabled proper stock validation in `SaleController.php` for both creation and updates
  - Enhanced error messages to show available vs requested quantities
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `database/migrations/2025_09_20_000000_modify_items_quantity_to_signed.php` (new migration)
  - `app/Http/Controllers/SaleController.php` (lines 344-346, 452)

**Sale Creation Payment Interface Enhancement - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Enhancement**: Added "Is Paid" toggle button for streamlined payment processing
- **Features**:
  - Toggle switch automatically sets Amount Paid to match Subtotal when activated
  - When deactivated, Amount Paid resets to 0.00 and becomes editable
  - Toggle is active by default for faster sale processing
  - Real-time calculation updates when items/discounts change
  - Read-only state when toggle is active to prevent manual conflicts
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/views/sales/create.blade.php` (lines 142-147, 312-328, 303-309)

**Sale Amount Paid Update Issue - FIXED**
- **Issue**: When editing sales via `sales/{id}/edit`, the "Amount Paid" field was not updating properly
- **Root Cause**: Controller validation expected `'paid'` field but form sent `'paid_amount'`
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `SaleController.php` validation to accept `'paid_amount'` instead of `'paid'`
  - Modified update logic to directly set the `paid_amount` field from form input
  - Removed unnecessary additional payment creation logic for simple updates
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/Http/Controllers/SaleController.php` (lines 428, 503-511)

**Favicon & Logo Consistency - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Enhancement**: Implemented consistent branding across all pages using the company logo
- **Features**:
  - Added favicon support using the company logo (`/public/images/logo.jpg`)
  - Updated all layout files to include proper favicon references
  - Consistent page titles with "Solar Sales" branding
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/sales/invoice-pdf.blade.php`

**PDF Invoice Logo Loading Issue - FIXED**
- **Issue**: JavaScript PDF generation was not loading the company logo properly
- **Root Cause**: External URL reference causing CORS restrictions and network dependencies
- **Solution**:
  - Changed logo source from external URL to local asset using `{{ asset('images/logo.jpg') }}`
  - Added `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to image tag
  - Enhanced html2canvas options with better CORS handling (`allowTaint: true`, `useCORS: true`)
  - Added white background option for better PDF rendering
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/views/sales/invoice-pdf.blade.php` (lines 61, 185-191)
